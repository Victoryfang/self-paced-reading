<p>
Welcome!  Thank you for participating in this study for the Linguistics Program at the College of William & Mary. 
  Your participation provides valuable data for the scientific study of language, and is greatly appreciated! 
  Please read the following instructions carefully:<br /><br />
</p>
<p>
   In this task, you will read sentences, silently to yourself, and answer yes/no questions about what you read. Only one sentence will appear on the screen at a time, and it will initially show up on the screen as a series of dashed lines, 
  like below. The dashes are covering the words of the sentence, and you will hit the space bar to reveal the words.<br><br>



___ ___ _____ ___ ________ __ ______ ___ ______________ ___ ____ ___ .<br><br>
  
  When you press the spacebar once, the first word of the sentence will appear on the first dash. When you press the space bar again, the second word will appear, 
  but the first word disappears. So you only ever see one word on the screen at a time. You will click through the rest of the sentence like that, reading it one word 
  at a time. No need to read outloud, unless that's how you normally read.<br><br> 
  
  After you click through the last word of the sentence, you will get a Yes/No question about the sentence you just read. Answer the question the best you can. 
  You can answer 'Yes' by pressing '1', and 'No' by pressing '2'. You will be notified when you respond incorrectly. If you get too many incorrect responses, 
  please take that as an indication to read more carefully. <br><br>
  
  The purpose of this study is to learn more about how people naturally read through a sentence. So make sure you are reading at a natural pace for yourself. The data is completely useless to us if you just speed through the sentence to
  get to the end. Not only will the data be useless to us in that case, but reading too quickly will negatively impact your accuracy on the comprehension questions. Your task is to read at
  a natural pace for yourself in order to understand and comprehend the meaning of the sentence to answer the question the best you can.<br><br></p>
  
<p>
 Note that we have included baseline sentences interspersed throughout the experiment. These sentences are easy to interpret, 
  so if you're paying attention you'll have no problem answering the follow-up question correctly. If you get too many of these incorrect, we will take 
  this as an indication that you are either not a native speaker or were not giving the task your full attention. <b>Under those 
  circumstances, we cannot pay you for the HIT.</b><br><br>
</p>  
<p>
You will receive the code for payment after you have completed the study. Enter this code into the Mechanical Turk form for this study
 to receive payment.<br><br>
  
</p>  
<p>
After you fill in the information below, the study will go over a few practice examples with you. Everything you enter below
is confidential. This is purely for scientific research conducted at the College of William & Mary. If you have any questions
  or concerns, please contact Dan Parker at dparker@wm.edu or 734-262-6447.<br><br></p>
